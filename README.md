# Shopping-Cart-Of-Products
The program computes the totals for a shopping cart of products shipped from different countries and finally displays a total detailed invoice in USD as well. First of all, a list of possible options will appear in the console (1 - add to cart, 2 - show catalog of products, 3 - invoice). Choose what option you want (e.g. after typing 1 in console, you need to enter the correct name of the product, exactly as written in the product list. You need to follow this step for adding more products - a product can be selected multiple times. Your cart will appear showing your products and their quantity. After finishing the shopping, select the invoice option - 3. The program will display your shopping cart, subtotal, shipping and the total amount). 
The IDE I used for the program is IntelliJ with JDK 15. Also, for the Unit Tests I used JUnit5 extensions.
